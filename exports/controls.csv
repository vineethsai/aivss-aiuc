- Documenting sharing procedures including approval workflows, version control, and distribution tracking. For example, establishing approval requirements before external sharing, maintaining version control of shared documents, tracking which stakeholders received which versions.","Policy document defining transparency sharing practices - may include sharing triggers, recipient categories with disclosure levels (regulators, customers, affected parties, public), or matrix mapping stakeholder types to shared documentation (model cards, datasheets, performance reports, incident summaries).",Prevent,Policy,Agent Untraceability,,ASI09,Human-Agent Trust Exploitation,N,High,"Detected cues: disclosure, approval.
